# E-Commerce Insights: Conversion Funnels and Retention Cohorts

This was the third project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned in Business Analytics. The purpose was to analyze the companies' raw transaction logs and turn the event logs into business metrics.

**Description:**

- 8-page spreadsheet
- Includes raw data, processed data, data analysis, and pivot tables.

**Process:**

I first explored, filtered, and cleaned the data. Then I created and built a conversion funnel. I prepared data for cohort analysis. Calculated retention rates. Lastly, I finalized the formatting and documentation for the client's readability.

**Data**

The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen

- 'raw_user_activity': Each row represents an activity, or event, by a user on the companyâ€™s website
  - 'user_id': unique customer IDs
  - 'event_type': the type of activity by the user
  - 'category_code': category of the product being viewed or purchased
  - 'brand': the company that makes the product
  - 'price': price of the product, in USD
  - 'event_date': date of the user activity, in YYYY-MM-DD format
- 'Table of Contents': Preformated yet empty table of contents sheet
- 'Executive Summary: Preformated yet empty executive summary sheet

**Assumptions:**

- The "raw_user_activity" sheet accurately reflects all website activity for the relevant timeframe.
- Missing values or inconsistencies in the data are minimal and can be ignored.
- The provided data format (columns, data types) is correct and consistent.

**Findings** 
  - The total conversion rate from view to purchase was 10%. While the view-to-shopping cart conversion rate was 29%.
  - Retention rates for the 2020-09 cohort group after the first month were only 13%; by the 4th month, it was down to 3%.


**Recommendations:**'

- Address Shopping Cart Abandonment and Purchase Conversion. Future projects can focus on the best approach such as product page vs checkout process as a source of funnel deterioration.
- Enhance customer engagement and loyalty. Potential marketing campaigns could be personalized communications, loyalty programs, and looking into customer support.
- Gain customer feedback for a more targeted strategy.
- Continue data-driven insights to follow changes in the cohort analysis.
