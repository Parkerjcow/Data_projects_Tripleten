This was my final project for the **TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program**. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned throughout the program. The purpose was to complete the Zomato onboarding project to demonstrate analytical skills for a mock company.

## DATA

TripleTen provided an archived file containing 5 separate Excel files from the mock company Zomato. For this project, I used 2 key files:

1. **Orders**: All orders made from the menu by all customers at all restaurants between Oct. 4th, 2017, and June 26th, 2020.
2. **Users**: All customers who completed orders during the designated time frame, including demographic information.

Additionally, the following tables were created for analysis purposes:
- **Measures Table**: Contains all calculated measures to maintain the integrity of the original files.
- **Calendar**: Stores all date-related information for calculations.
- **Segmentations**: Contains RFM scores and customer segmentation details.
- **RFM Table**: Stores all RFM calculations for the analysis.

## Description

- **Analysis Type**: Customer Segmentation Analysis
- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **Visuals Included**:
  - KPI Cards
  - Pie Charts
  - Bar Charts
  - RFM Analysis
- **Dashboard Pages**: 2 pages in Power BI

## Assumptions

The following assumptions were made about the data and context:
1. The provided datasets are accurate, complete, and consistent.
2. Missing values or inconsistencies are minimal and will not significantly impact the analysis.
3. Column descriptions accurately reflect the content of each table.
4. Provided tables (orders and users) contain all the necessary information for the analysis.
5. Zomatoâ€™s business context and industry trends are considered during data interpretation.

---

## Process

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Fully reviewed the problem, requirements, and criteria for success.
2. **Decomposition Plan**: Created a structured research plan (first submission).
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards (second submission).
4. **Reporting**: Compiled findings into a detailed written report (final submission).

---

## Findings

The analysis revealed the following key insights about Zomatoâ€™s customer base:

1. **Demographics**:
   - Customers are predominantly 23-year-old unmarried men.
   - There is a natural distribution of age, primarily between 18 and 34.
   - Women closely follow men in numbers, but single customers greatly outnumber married ones.

2. **Family Size**:
   - Most customers have small family sizes (2â€“3 members).

3. **Education & Employment**:
   - Customers are often educated but unemployed.
   - Employed customers tend to earn below the middle-class income threshold (\<$50,000/year).
