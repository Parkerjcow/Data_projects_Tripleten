# Zuber Database Analysis

## Overview

This project dives into the Zuber ride-hailing database to uncover patterns in customer behavior, service performance, and revenue trends. Using SQL and statistical techniques, the analysis aims to inform strategic decisions that enhance efficiency and user satisfaction.

## Project Objectives

1. Analyze customer usage trends across time, geography, and demographics.
2. Investigate the performance and efficiency of Zuber services.
3. Develop actionable recommendations to improve rider experience and profitability.


## Key Highlights
1. Customer Behavior
  - Identified peak usage periods and high-demand zones.
  - Analyzed repeat usage patterns, revealing valuable customer demographics for retention strategies.

2. Service Efficiency
  - Benchmarked average response times and trip completion rates.
  - Flagged underperforming regions with slower response metrics.
  - Suggested geographic shifts or incentive programs to increase service coverage.

3. Revenue Insights
  - Evaluated pricing models and their impact on ride volume and revenue.
  - Found areas where optimized pricing could boost profitability without compromising satisfaction.

## Tools & Methodologies
SQL: Used to query, clean, and analyze structured relational data.
Statistical Analysis:
