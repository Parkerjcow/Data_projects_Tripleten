# E-Commerce Insights: Conversion Funnels and Retention Cohorts

This was the third project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned in Business Analytics. The purpose was to analyze the companies' raw transaction logs and turn the event logs into business metrics.

**Description:**

- 8-page spreadsheet
- Includes raw data, processed data, data analysis, and pivot tables.

**Process:**

I first explored, filtered, and cleaned the data. Then I created and built a conversion funnel. I prepared data for cohort analysis. Calculated retention rates. Lastly, I finalized the formatting and documentation for the client's readability.

**Data**

The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen

- 'raw_user_activity': Each row represents an activity, or event, by a user on the companyâ€™s website
  - 'user_id': unique customer IDs
  - 'event_type': the type of activity by the user
  - 'category_code': category of the product being viewed or purchased
  - 'brand': the company that makes the product
  - 'price': price of the product, in USD
  - 'event_date': date of the user activity, in YYYY-MM-DD format
- 'Table of Contents': Preformated yet empty table of contents sheet
- 'Executive Summary: Preformated yet empty executive summary sheet

**Assumptions:**

- The "raw_user_activity" sheet accurately reflects all website activity for the relevant timeframe.
- Missing values or inconsistencies in the data are minimal and can be ignored.
- The provided data format (columns, data types) is correct and consistent.

**Findings** 
- Out of 10,453 people who viewed a product, 29.04% added items to their cart, but only 35.61% actually made a purchase. This means the total conversion rate was 10.34%. The data points to a significant drop-off between browsing and buying, which could indicate potential issues in the checkout process that might need improvement.
- User retention drops significantly after the first month, with only small percentages of users staying active in the following months. For instance, in September 2020, just 50% of users were retained in the second month, and this figure dropped drastically to 0% by the third month. Improving long-term engagement will be key to addressing this issue.


**Recommendations:**'

- Address Shopping Cart Abandonment and Purchase Conversion. Future projects can focus on the best approach such as product page vs checkout process as a source of funnel deterioration.
- Enhance customer engagement and loyalty. Potential marketing campaigns could be personalized communications, loyalty programs, and looking into customer support.
- Gain customer feedback for a more targeted strategy.
- Continue data-driven insights to follow changes in the cohort analysis.
