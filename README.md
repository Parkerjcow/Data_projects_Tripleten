# Saving SuperStore: Turning Insights into Action

This was the fourth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned about Tableau Visualization. The purpose was to consultant the company by reviewing the storeâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

# Description:
7-page Tableau Visualization
Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboard.

**Process:**

I first joined the sheets. Then I determined profit and loss centers. Lastly, I examined the contribution returns had on profits.

**Data**

The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

 - 'Superstore.xls': each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
 - 'orders': details all fields for each ordered item
 - 'returns': details all fields for each returned item

**Assumptions:**

- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.
- The advertising department needs recommendations.

**Findings:**

- Profit Centers are Office Supplies and Technology in the West Region while loss centers are Office Supplies and Furniture in the Central Region based on profits.
- Subcategories profit centers are Copiers, Phones, and Accessories while loss centers are Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies based on profits.
- Several products are causing negative profits, some as high as $20k in losses.
- Advertising campaigns should be targeted towards Indiana in October, Vermont in November, and Washington in March.
- Returns are a serious problem with many products having high return rates, as high as 100%.
- There are several customers with high return rates, as high as 100%.
- When considering average profits vs return rate, there are a few individual products that are not worth selling.

**Recommendations:**

- Continue to optimize sales and marketing efforts in profit centers to maintain profitability. Invest in marketing and product development to further capitalize on their success.
- Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the underlying reasons for losses. Consider product adjustments, pricing strategies, or operational changes to improve performance. If these products consistently generate negative profits, consider discontinuing them.
- Investigate products with negative profits. If these products consistently generate negative profits, consider discontinuing them.
- Target advertising campaigns while allocating advertising budgets of 1/5 the state's monthly profits during their most profitable seasons to maximize returns. Consider regional preferences and market trends when designing advertising campaigns.
- Investigate high return rates as this is a significant contributor to negative profits.
- Analyze customer behavior to identify repeat offenders and take appropriate measures to address their concerns and implement customer loyalty programs.
