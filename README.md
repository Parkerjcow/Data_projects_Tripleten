**Data**
- The data was one Excel spreadsheet file:
  - 'Superstore.xls': each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
  - 'orders': details all fields for each ordered item
  - 'returns': details all fields for each returned item

**Description:**
- 9-page Tableau Visualization and Presentation
- Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and stories

**Assumptions:**
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.

**Process:**
I first joined the sheets. Then I analyzed data using visualizations to determine what is causing returns. I built a dashboard for monitoring returns. Lastly, I created a Tableau story to present my findings.

**Findings:**
- Returned purchases are the leading cause of declining profits at Superstore.
- There is a positive correlation between sales and returns.
- The technology category has the largest return rate.
- There are several customers who have a return rate of 100%.
- Each state had different rates of return for different sub-categories.
- Orders made throughout the year had higher return rates depending on the month.
- Return rates do not correlate with the amount of product sold, some of the lowest-selling products had a return rate of 100%.
